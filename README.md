# LaTeX Work
I really like LaTeX. Microsoft Word worked great for the first few years of college, but I started wondering what my professors were using as a typeface. I discovered LaTeX and it has been my primary text processing method since. 

A great tool for using LaTeX on the go: www.sharelatex.com 

## Linear Algebra

My linear algebra professor allows us to have a crib sheet, so I decided to create mine using LaTeX. By the time the exam rolls around, I have rewritten all of the material already, and generally don't even look at the crib sheet during the exam.

This file is the result of a lot of customization in order to place the most amount of content on the smallest number of pages. It's almost absurd to put this much content down. However, the beauty of LaTeX is that I can easily transfer all of this to a book format, and keep it as a reference for later in life.
